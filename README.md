All included elements will now be available for use - see release notes for details on which elements are included in the bundle.

### As a Script

Import the script on each page that uses one or more catalyst elements.

```html
<script src="node_modules/@catalyst-elements/bundle/catalyst-elements.es5.min.js"></script>
```

Please note that this script has been transpiled to es5 and thus use of `custom-elements-es5-adapter.js` or an equivalent library is required. See [es5 support](https://github.com/catalyst/CatalystElements/wiki/Browser-Compatibility#es5-support) on the Catalyst Elements wiki for details.
